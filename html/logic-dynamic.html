<div id="preamble">

<p>
Logics of programs are modal logics arising from the idea of
associating a modality \([\alpha]\) with each computer program
\(\alpha\) of a programming language. The formula \([\alpha]A\) is
then to be read as: \(A\) is true after the execution of the program
\(\alpha\). This idea comes from the line of works by Engeler [1967],
Hoare [1969], Yanov [1959], and others who formulated and studied
logical languages in which the properties of program connectives can
be expressed. The algorithmic logic (AL) first developed by Salwicki
[1970] and the dynamic logic (DL) elaborated by Pratt [1976] are
proper continuations of these works. We will here concentrate on DL.
The numerous papers devoted to DL and its variants as well as its many
applications in program verification and data structures show that it
constitutes a useful tool for studying the properties of programs.
Pratt chose to depict DL on what one might call the first-order level,
and it was his work that triggered Fischer and Ladner [1979] to define
the propositional variant of DL a couple of years later. This article
presents an introduction to PDL, the propositional variant of DL.</p>

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Dynamic Logics (DL) are modal logics for representing the states and
the events of dynamic systems. The language of DLs is both an
assertion language able to express properties of computation states,
and a programming language able to express properties of system
transitions between these states. DLs are <em>logics of programs</em>,
and permit to talk and reason about states of affairs, processes,
changes, and results.</p>

<p>
Pratt&rsquo;s original dynamic logic of programs was a
<em>first-order</em> modal logic. <em>Propositional Dynamic Logic</em>
(PDL) is the propositional counterpart of it. It was presented as a
logic in its own right in Fischer and Ladner [1979]. Being
propositional, the language of PDL makes no use of terms, predicates,
or functions. Thus in PDL, there are two syntactic categories:
propositions and programs.</p>

<p>
To give meaning to statements in PDL, we typically work with an
abstract semantics in terms of Labeled Transition Systems (LTS). LTSs
can be seen as a generalization of Kripke models, where transitions
between worlds, or states, are &ldquo;labeled&rdquo; by names of
<em>atomic</em> programs. A valuation indicates for every state what
<em>propositions</em> are true in it. A transition labeled \(\pi\)
from one state \(x\) to a state \(y\)&mdash;noted \(xR(\pi)y\), or
\((x,y) \in R(\pi)\)&mdash;indicates that starting in \(x\), there is
a possible execution of the program \(\pi\) that finishes in \(y\). If
the proposition \(A\) is true in \(y\), then the formula
\(\langle\pi\rangle A\) is true in \(x\): i.e., in the state \(x\)
there is a possible execution of the program \(\pi\) that ends in a
state satisfying \(A\). One recognizes in \(\langle\pi\rangle\) a
modality reminiscent of the modality of possibility (often noted
\(\Diamond\)) of modal logic. Unsurprisingly, there is also a
corresponding notion of necessity (whose modality is often noted
\(\Box\)). The formula \([\pi]A\) is true in the state \(x\) if \(A\)
is true in every state reachable from \(x\) by a transition labeled
\(\pi\).</p>

<p>
The possible executions of complex programs can be next defined
compositionally. For instance, a program &ldquo;first \(\alpha\), then
\(\beta\)&rdquo; is a complex program, more specifically a
<em>sequence</em>. A possible execution can be represented in an LTS
by composing a two-step transition&mdash;a transition which can be
signified by \(R(\alpha;\beta)\)&mdash;between the states \(x\) and
\(y\): there is a possible execution in the state \(x\) of the program
\(\alpha\) that finishes in a state \(z\) and there is a possible
execution in \(z\) of the program \(\beta\) that finishes in the state
\(y\). If the proposition \(A\) is true in \(y\), then the formula
\(\langle \alpha;\beta\rangle A\) is be true in the state \(x\). The
programs \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) could be complex program themselves.
Still more programs can be expressed with more constructs that we will
present in due time.</p>

<p>
A program is then seen in an extensional way: it is a binary relation
between pairs of states of an LTS. Precisely, it is the set of pairs
of the form \((x,y)\) such that the program can be executed in the
state \(x\) and can lead to the state \(y\). On the other hand, a
proposition is a statement about a state; it is either true or false
in a state. A proposition can thus also be seen in an extensional way:
the set of states of the LTS where it is true.</p>

<p>
With the acronym PDL, we refer here precisely to the propositional
dynamic logic with the following program constructs: sequence,
non-deterministic choice, unbounded iteration, and test. We present it
in
 <a href="#DefiFundResu">section 2</a>,
 together with some properties and fundamental results. In particular,
we will address its axiomatization and its decidability.</p>

<p>
The Hoare calculus from Hoare [1969] is a landmark for logics of
programs. It concerns the truth of statements of the form
\(\{A\}\alpha\{B\}\)&mdash;meaning that with the precondition \(A\)
the program \(\alpha\) always has \(B\) as a post-condition&mdash;and
is defined axiomatically. It comes from a want of rigorous methods to
reason about the properties of programs, and thus giving to the
activity of programming a certain place in the realm of science.
Burstall [1974] saw the analogy between modal logics and reasoning
about programs. But the actual work on it started with Pratt [1976]
after it was suggested to him by some of the students of a course he
was giving, specifically about logics of programs. PDL comes from
Pratt&rsquo;s interpretation of Hoare&rsquo;s calculus in the
formalism of modal logic. An introduction to the genesis of PDL can be
found in Pratt [1980b]. The Hoare-triple \(\{A\}\alpha\{B\}\) is
captured by the PDL formula \(A \to [\alpha]B\) meaning literally that
if \(A\) is true, then every successfully terminating execution of
\(\alpha\) will end with \(B\) being true. With this connection
realized, it is a routine to prove the initial rules of Hoare&rsquo;s
calculus using exclusively the axiomatization of PDL. This is
something we will do in detail in
 <a href="#StruProgCorrProg">section 3</a>
 which concentrates on the reasoning about the correctness of
structured programs.</p>

<p>
Additional topics related to PDL include results concerning
comparative power of expression, decidability, complexity, and
completeness of a number of interesting variants obtained by extending
or restricting PDL in various ways. Since its inception, many variants
of PDL have received attention. These variants may consider
deterministic programs, restricted tests, non-regular programs,
programs as automata, complementation and intersection of programs,
converse and infinite computations, etc. We will present some of them
in
 <a href="#SomeVari">section 4</a>,
 providing some pointers regarding their relative expressivity, their
axiomatizations, and their computational complexity.</p>

<p>
We conclude in
 <a href="#Conc">section 5</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="DefiFundResu">2. Definitions and fundamental results</h2>

<p>
We present the syntax and semantics of PDL in
 <a href="#SyntSema">section 2.1</a>.
 The proof theory of PDL is presented in
 <a href="#AxioComp">section 2.2</a>
 with axiomatizations and pointers to the literature on completeness.
We address the problem of decidability and complexity in
 <a href="#DeciComp">section 2.3</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="SyntSema">2.1 Syntax and semantics</h3>

<p>
Propositional dynamic logic (PDL) is designed for representing and
reasoning about propositional properties of programs. Its syntax is
based upon two sets of symbols: a countable set \(\Phi_0\) of atomic
formulas and a countable set \(\Pi_0\) of atomic programs. Complex
formulas and complex programs over this base are defined as
follows.</p>

<ul>

<li>Every atomic formula is a formula.</li>

<li>\(0\) (&ldquo;false&rdquo;) is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(A\) is a formula then \(\lnot A\) (&ldquo;not \(A\)&rdquo;)
is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(A\) and \(B\) are formulas then \((A\lor B)\) (&ldquo;\(A\)
or \(B\)&rdquo;) is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(\alpha\) is a program and <em>A</em> is a formula then
\([\alpha]A\) (&ldquo;every execution of \(\alpha\) from the present
state leads to a state where \(A\) is true&rdquo;) is a formula.</li>

<li>Every atomic program is a program.</li>

<li>If \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are programs then \((\alpha;\beta)\)
(&ldquo;do \(\alpha\) followed by \(\beta\)&rdquo;) is a program.</li>

<li>If \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are programs then
\((\alpha\cup\beta)\) (&ldquo;do \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\),
non-deterministically&rdquo;) is a program.</li>

<li>If \(\alpha\) is a program then \(\alpha^*\) (&ldquo;repeat
\(\alpha\) a finite, but non-deterministically determined, number of
times&rdquo;) is a program.</li>

<li>If \(A\) is a formula then \(A?\) (&ldquo;proceed if \(A\) is
true, else fail&rdquo;) is a program.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The other Boolean connectives \(1\), \(\land\), \(\to\), and
\(\leftrightarrow\) are used as abbreviations in the standard way. In
addition, we abbreviate \(\lnot[\alpha]\lnot A\) to
\(\langle\alpha\rangle A\) (&ldquo;some execution of \(\alpha\) from
the present state leads to a state where \(A\) is true&rdquo;) as in
modal logic. We write \(\alpha^n\) for \(\alpha;\ldots ;\alpha\) with
\(n\) occurrences of \(\alpha\). More formally:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\alpha^0 := 1?\)</li>

<li>\(\alpha^{n+1} := \alpha;\alpha^n\)</li>
</ul> Also:

<ul>

<li>\(\alpha^+ := \alpha;\alpha^*\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
is often useful to represent an iteration that is unbounded but occurs
at least once. Finally, we adopt the standard rules for omission of
parentheses.</p>

<p>
Formulas can be used to describe the properties that hold after the
successful execution of a program. For example, the formula
\([\alpha\cup\beta]A\) means that whenever program \(\alpha\) or
\(\beta\) is successfully executed, a state is reached where \(A\)
holds, whereas the formula \(\langle (\alpha;\beta)^*\rangle A\) means
that there is a sequence of alternating executions of \(\alpha\) and
\(\beta\) such that a state is reached where \(A\) holds. Semantically
speaking, formulas are interpreted by sets of states and programs are
interpreted by binary relations over states in a transition system.
More precisely, the meaning of PDL formulas and programs is
interpreted over Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) \(M = (W,R,V)\)
where \(W\) is a nonempty set of worlds or states, \(R\) is a mapping
from the set \(\Pi_0\) of atomic programs into binary relations on
\(W\) and \(V\) is a mapping from the set \(\Phi_0\) of atomic
formulas into subsets of \(W\).</p>

<p>
Informally, the mapping \(R\) assigns to each atomic program
\(\pi\in\Pi_0\) some binary relation \(R(\pi)\) on \(W\) with the
intended meaning that \(xR(\pi)y\) iff there exists an execution of
\(\pi\) from \(x\) that leads to \(y\), whereas the mapping \(V\)
assigns to each atomic formula \(p\in\Phi_0\) some subset \(V(p)\) of
\(W\) with the intended meaning that \(x \in V(p)\) iff \(p\) is true
in the state \(x\). Given our readings of \(0\), \(\lnot A\), \(A\lor
B\), \([\alpha]A\), \(\alpha;\beta\), \(\alpha\cup\beta\),
\(\alpha^*\) and \(A?\), it is clear that \(R\) and \(V\) must be
extended inductively as follows to supply the intended meanings for
the complex programs and formulas:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(xR(\alpha;\beta)y\) iff there exists a world \(z\) such that
\(xR(\alpha)z\) and \(zR(\beta)y\)</li>

<li>\(xR(\alpha\cup\beta)y\) iff \(xR(\alpha)y\) or
\(xR(\beta)y\)</li>

<li>\(xR(\alpha^*)y\) iff there exists a non-negative integer \(n\)
and there exists a sequence of states \(z_0, \ldots, z_n\) such that
\(z_0 = x\), \(z_n = y\) and for all \(k = 1 \ldots n\),
\(z_{k-1}R(\alpha)z_k\)</li>

<li>\(xR(A?)y\) iff \(x = y\) and \(y \in V(A)\)</li>

<li>\(V(0) = \emptyset\)</li>

<li>\(V(\lnot A) = W \setminus V(A)\)</li>

<li>\(V((A\lor B) = V(A) \cup V(B)\)</li>

<li>\(V([\alpha]A) = \{x \mid \text{for all worlds } y, \text{ if }
xR(\alpha)y \text{ then } y \in V(A)\}\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If \(x \in V(A)\) then we say that \(A\) is satisfied at state \(x\)
in \(M\), or \(\ldquo M, x\) sat \(A\rdquo\).</p>

Call \(M\) the LTS depicted above on the left and \(M'\) the LTS

<li>\(M',y_3\) sat \([\pi_1 \cup \pi_2] 0\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now consider a formula \(A\). We say that \(A\) is valid in \(M\) or
that \(M\) is a model of \(A\), or &ldquo;\(M \models A\)&rdquo;, iff
for all worlds \(x\), \(x \in V(A)\). \(A\) is said to be valid, or
&ldquo;\(\models A\)&rdquo;, iff for all models \(M\), \(M \models
A\). We say that \(A\) is satisfiable in \(M\) or that \(M\) satisfies
\(A\), or &ldquo;\(M\) sat \(A\)&rdquo;, iff there exists a world
\(x\) such that \(x \in V(A)\). \(A\) is said to be satisfiable, or
&ldquo;sat \(A\)&rdquo;, iff there exists a model \(M\) such that
\(M\) sat \(A\). It is notably the case that,</p>

<p class="indent">
sat \(A\) iff not \(\models \lnot A\)
<br />
\(\models A\) iff not sat \(\lnot A\) </p>

<p>
Some remarkable formulas of PDL are valid. (The reader may try to
prove them formally, or at least start convincing themselves on the
few examples displayed above.)</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\models [\alpha ; \beta]A \leftrightarrow [\alpha][\beta]A\)
<br />
\(\models [\alpha \cup \beta]A \leftrightarrow [\alpha]A \land
[\beta]A\)
<br />
\(\models [\alpha^*]A \leftrightarrow A \land [\alpha][\alpha^*]A\)
<br />
\([A?]B \leftrightarrow (A \rightarrow B)\) </p>

<p>
Equivalently, we can write them under their dual form.</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\langle\alpha ; \beta\rangle A \leftrightarrow
\langle\alpha\rangle\langle\beta\rangle A\)
<br />
\(\langle\alpha \cup \beta\rangle A \leftrightarrow
\langle\alpha\rangle A \lor \langle\beta\rangle A\)
<br />
\(\langle\alpha^*\rangle A \leftrightarrow A \lor \langle\alpha\rangle
\langle\alpha^*\rangle A\)
<br />
\(\langle A?\rangle B \leftrightarrow A \land B\) </p>

<p>
One interesting notion concerns the information, expressed with PDL
formulas, that is contained in an LTS. The behavior of a system
described as an LTS is indeed often slightly hidden in its form. For
instance, on simple inspection, it is easy to convince oneself that
the two LTSs depicted above have the same behavior, and satisfy the
same PDL formulas. To finish this section on syntax and semantics we
give the theoretical foundation of these claims.</p>

<p>
Given two LTSs, one may ask whether they satisfy the same formulas.
The notion of bisimulation has become the standard measure for
equivalence of Kripke models and Labeled Transition Systems. A
<em>bisimulation</em> between the LTSs \(M = (W,R,V)\) and \(M' =
(W',R',V')\) is a binary relation \(Z\) between their set of states
such that for all worlds \(x\) in \(W\) and for all worlds \(x'\) in
\(W'\), if \(xZx'\) then,</p>

<ul>

<li>for all atomic formulas \(p\in \Phi_0\), we have \(x\in V(p)\) iff
\(x' \in V'(p)\),</li>

<li>for all atomic programs \(\pi \in \Pi_0\) and for all worlds \(y
\in W\), we have that if \(x R(\pi)y\) then there exists a world \(y'
\in W'\) such that \(yZy'\) and \(x' R'(\pi)y'\),</li>

<li>for all atomic programs \(\pi \in \Pi_0\) and for all worlds \(y'
\in W'\), we have that if \(x' R'(\pi)y'\) then there exists a world
\(y \in W\) such that \(yZy'\) and \(x R(\pi)y\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
We say that two LTSs are <em>bisimilar</em> when there exists a
bisimulation between them.</p>

<p>
It is the case that in two bisimilar LTSs \(M = (W,R,V)\) and \(M' =
(W',R',V')\), for all worlds \(x\) in \(W\) and for all worlds \(x'\)
in \(W'\), if \(xZx'\) then for all PDL formulas \(A\), \(x \in V(A)\)
iff \(x' \in V'(A)\). Thus when two LTSs are bisimilar under the
definition of bisimulation above, it is the case that, if \(xZx'\)
then</p>

<ul>

<li>for all programs \(\alpha\) and for all worlds \(y \in W\), we
have that if \(x R(\alpha)y\) then there exists a world \(y' \in W'\)
such that \(yZy'\) and \(x' R'(\alpha)y'\),</li>

<li>for all programs \(\alpha\) and for all worlds \(y' \in W'\), we
have that if \(x' R'(\alpha)y'\) then there exists a world \(y \in W\)
such that \(yZy'\) and \(x R(\alpha)y\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hence one can simply compare the behaviors of two LTSs by inspecting
solely the atomic programs and safely extrapolate on the comparative
behavior of these LTSs even for complex programs. We say that the
program constructs of PDL are <em>safe for bisimulation</em>. See Van
Benthem [1998] for precise characterizations of program constructs
that are safe for bisimulation.</p>

<p>
It is readily seen that the two instances of LTSs above are bisimilar.
A bisimulation \(Z\) between the two models \(M\) and \(M'\) depicted
in the figures above can be given as: \(Z = \{(x_1,y_1), (x_1,y_2),
(x_2, y_3), (x_2, y_4)\}\). The states \(x_1\) and \(y_1\) satisfy
exactly the same PDL formulas. So do the states \(x_1\) and \(y_2\),
etc.</p>

<h3 id="AxioComp">2.2 Axiomatization and completeness</h3>

<p>
The purpose of the proof theory is to provide the characterization of
validity&mdash;the property \(\models A\)&mdash;in terms of axioms and
rules of inference. In this section, we define a deducibility
predicate \(\vdash\) inductively by operations on formulas that depend
only on their syntactic structure in such a way that for all formulas
\(A\),</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\vdash A\) iff \(\models A\). </p>

<p>
Of course, PDL is an extension of classical propositional logic. We
first expect that all propositional tautologies hold, and all
propositional reasoning is allowed. In particular, modus ponens is a
valid rule: from \(A\) and \(A \rightarrow B\) infer \(B\). For any
program \(\alpha\), restricting an LTS to the relation \(R(\alpha)\)
we obtain a Kripke model in which the logic of the modality
\([\alpha]\) is the weakest propositional normal modal logic, namely,
the logic K. Thus, PDL contains every instance of the familiar
distribution axiom schema</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(K)</dt>
<dd>\([\alpha](A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow ([\alpha]A \rightarrow
[\alpha]B)\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
and it is closed under the following rule of inference
(<em>necessitation</em> rule)</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(N)</dt>
<dd>from \(A\) infer \([\alpha]A\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
A modal logic is normal if it obeys (K) and (N). An important property
of normal modal logics is the <em>distributivity over the
conjunction</em> \(\land\): the formula \([\alpha](A \land B)
\leftrightarrow ([\alpha]A \land [\alpha]B)\) can be proven using (K),
(N), and propositional reasoning. The rule of <em>monotony</em> can
also be proven using (K), (N), and propositional reasoning: from \(A
\rightarrow B\) infer \([\alpha]A \rightarrow [\alpha]B\).</p>

<p>
PDL is the least normal modal logic containing every instance of the
following axiom schemas</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(A1)</dt>
<dd>\([\alpha;\beta]A \leftrightarrow [\alpha][\beta]A\)</dd>
<dt>(A2)</dt>
<dd>\([\alpha \cup \beta]A \leftrightarrow [\alpha]A \land
[\beta]A\)</dd>
<dt>(A3)</dt>
<dd>\([\alpha^*]A \leftrightarrow A \land [\alpha][\alpha^*]A\)</dd>
<dt>(A4)</dt>
<dd>\([A?]B \leftrightarrow (A \rightarrow B)\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
and closed under the following rule of inference (<em>loop
invariance</em> rule):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(I)</dt>
<dd>from \(A \rightarrow [\alpha]A\) infer \(A \rightarrow
[\alpha^*]A\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If \(X\) is a set of formulas and \(A\) is a formula then we say that
\(A\) is \(\vdash\)-deducible from \(X\), or &ldquo;\(X \vdash
A\)&rdquo;, if there exists a sequence \(A_0, A_1, \ldots A_n\) of
formulas such that \(A_n = A\) and for all \(i \leq n\), \(A_i\) is an
instance of an axiom schema, or a formula of \(X\), or comes from
earlier formulas of the sequence by a rule of inference. Further,
\(\vdash A\) iff \(\emptyset \vdash A\); in this case we say that
\(A\) is \(\vdash\)-deducible. \(X\) is said to be
\(\vdash\)-consistent iff not \(X \vdash 0\). It is easy to establish
that the rule (I) can be replaced by the following axiom schema
(<em>induction</em> axiom schema):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(A5)</dt>
<dd>\(A \land [\alpha^*](A \rightarrow [\alpha]A) \rightarrow
[\alpha^*]A\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Let us first establish that (I) is a derived rule of the proof system
based on (A1), (A2), (A3), (A4) and (A5):</p>

<table class="cell-left cellpad-med-dense vert-top indent">

<p>
The axiomatization of PDL based on axiom schemas (A1), (A2), (A3),
(A4) and (A5) has been proposed in Segerberg [1977]. It is immediate
from the definitions above that \(\vdash\) is sound with respect to
\(\models\), i.e.,</p>

<p class="indent">
for all formulas \(A\), if \(\vdash A\), then \(\models A\). </p>

<p>
The proof proceeds by induction on the length of \(A\)&rsquo;s
deduction in \(\vdash\). The question of the completeness of
\(\vdash\) with respect to \(\models\), i.e.,</p>

<p class="indent">
for all formulas \(A\), if \(\models A\), then \(\vdash A\), </p>

<p>
was pursued by several logicians. The line of reasoning presented in
Segerberg [1977] was the first attempt to prove the completeness of
\(\vdash\). Soon, Parikh came up with a proof, too. When early 1978
Segerberg found a flaw in his argument (which he repaired eventually),
Parikh published what can be considered the first proof of the
completeness of \(\vdash\) in Parikh [1978]. Different proofs of
completeness of \(\vdash\) have been published since, e.g. Kozen and
Parikh [1981]. More details can be found in Pratt [2017].</p>

<p>
Different alternative proof theories of PDL have also been sought
after. Even early on, notably in Pratt [1978]. Let us then also
mention the completeness of related theories by Nishimura [1979] and
Vakarelov [1983].</p>

<p>
An alternative formulation of a deducibility predicate for PDL
exploits an infinitary rule of inference, as for instance in Goldblatt
[1992a]. (An infinitary rule of inference takes an infinite number of
premises.) Let \(\vdash'\) be the deducibility predicate corresponding
in the language of propositional dynamic logic to the least normal
modal logic containing every instance of the axiom schemas (A1), (A2),
(A3) and (A4) and closed under the following infinitary rule of
inference:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(I&prime;)</dt>
<dd>from \(\{[\beta][\alpha^n]A : n\geq 0\}\) infer
\([\beta][\alpha^*]A\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It can be proved that \(\vdash'\) is both sound and complete with
respect \(\models\), i.e.,</p>

<p class="indent">
for all formulas \(A\), \(\vdash' A\) iff \(\models A\). </p>

<p>
In other words, as far as generating the set of all valid formulas is
concerned, the proof systems \(\vdash\) and \(\vdash'\) are
equivalent.</p>

<h3 id="DeciComp">2.3 Decidability and complexity</h3>

<p>
The aim of the complexity theory is to establish the computability of
the property sat \(A\) in terms of resources of time or space. The
complexity of a logic \(\mathcal{L}\) is often identified with the
problem of deciding the satisfiability of its formulas, defined
as:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag6em">
<dt>(L-SAT)</dt>
<dd>Given a formula \(A\) of \(\mathcal{L}\), is \(A\)
satisfiable?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In this section, we investigate the complexity of the following
decision problem:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag6em">
<dt>(PDL-SAT)</dt>
<dd>Given a formula \(A\) of PDL, is \(A\) satisfiable?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The complete axiomatization of PDL is a recursive definition of the
set of valid PDL formulas, or in other words, of the set of formulas
whose negation is not satisfiable. Hence, concerning the problem
(PDL-SAT), we have a sub-procedure that would answer &ldquo;no&rdquo;
if the PDL formula \(A\) were not satisfiable. The sub-procedure (SP1)
consists in enumerating all the formulas \(\vdash\)-deducible,
starting from the axioms and inferring other theorems with the help of
the inference rules. Given enough time, if a formula is
\(\vdash\)-deducible, the sub-procedure would find it eventually.
Thus, if \(A\) is not satisfiable, (SP1) must eventually find \(\lnot
A\), and answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; when it does.</p>

<p>
However, if the formula \(A\) is satisfiable, then (SP1) would never
find \(\lnot A\). It would run forever, and one could not be sure
about it at any time. But there is a way out of this uncertainty. We
can also think of a second sub-procedure that answers
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; if a PDL formula is satisfiable. Indeed, one of the
earliest results on PDL was the proof that PDL has the <em>finite
model property</em>, i.e.,</p>

<p class="indent">
For all formulas \(A\), if sat \(A\) then there exists a finite model
\(M\) such that \(M\) sat \(A\). </p>

<p>
The finite model property offers a basis for a sub-procedure (SP2)
that consists in enumerating one by one the finite models of PDL and
testing whether one of them satisfies the formula. (For all formulas
\(A\) and for all finite models \(M\), it is easy to test if \(M\) sat
\(A\) by applying the definition of \(V(A)\).) Thus, if \(A\) is
satisfiable, it must eventually find a model \(M\) such that \(M\) sat
\(A\), and answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; when it does. Symmetrically to the
first sub-procedure (SP1), if the formula \(A\) is not satisfiable,
then (SP2) will never find a model satisfying it, it will run forever,
and one could not be sure about it at any time.</p>

<p>
Now, combining (SP1) and (SP2) together we have a way of deciding
whether a PDL formula \(A\) is satisfiable. It suffices to run them in
parallel: if \(A\) is satisfiable then (SP2) will eventually answer
&ldquo;yes&rdquo;, if \(A\) is not satisfiable then (SP1) will
eventually answer &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The procedure halts when either
(SP1) or (SP2) provides an answer.</p>

<p>
If the procedure that is obtained is sufficient to conclude that the
problem (PDL-SAT) is decidable, it is very inefficient in practice.
There is a result&mdash;due to Fischer and Ladner [1979] and Kozen and
Parikh [1981]&mdash; stronger than the finite model property, that is
<em>small model property</em>:</p>

<p class="indent">
For all formulas \(A\), if sat \(A\) then there exists a finite model
\(M\) of size exponential in \(A\) such that \(M\) sat \(A\). </p>

<p>
This means that we would now know when to stop looking for a model
satisfying a formula in the procedure (SP2). Hence, we can use (SP2)
to test whether a formula is satisfiable, but once we have exhausted
all small models, we can conclude that the formula is not satisfiable.
This yields a procedure that runs non-deterministically in exponential
time (NEXPTIME): guess a model of size at most singly exponential, and
check whether it satisfies the formula. But the key results in the
complexity theory of PDL come from Fischer and Ladner [1979] and Pratt
[1980a]. Observing that a formula of PDL can efficiently describe the
computation of a linear space bounded alternating Turing machine,
Fischer and Ladner [1979] first established the lower bound of
exponential time of (PDL-SAT). The EXPTIME upper bound of (PDL-SAT)
has been obtained by Pratt [1980a], who adapted the method of semantic
tableaux to PDL. Thus, (PDL-SAT) is EXPTIME-complete. (An algorithm
more efficient in practice, although still running in deterministic
exponential time in the worst case, is proposed in De Giacomo and
Massacci [2000].)</p>

<h2 id="StruProgCorrProg">3. Structured programming and correctness of programs</h2>

<p>
Historically, logics of programs stem from the work in the late 1960s
of computer scientists interested in assigning meaning to programming
languages and finding a rigorous standard for proofs about the
programs. For example such proofs may be about the correctness of a
program with respect to an expected behavior, or about the termination
of a program. A seminal paper is Floyd [1967] which presents an
analysis of the properties of structured computer programs using
<em>flowcharts</em>. Some early work such as Yanov [1959] or Engeler
[1967] had advanced and studied formal languages in which the
properties of program connectives can be expressed. The formalism of
Hoare [1969] was a milestone in the advent of PDL. It was proposed as
a rigorous axiomatic interpretation of Floyd&rsquo;s flowcharts. We
often talk about Hoare logic, or Floyd-Hoare logic, or Hoare calculus
when referring to this formalism. Hoare calculus is concerned with the
truth of statements (&ldquo;Hoare triples&rdquo;), such as
\(\{A\}\alpha\{B\}\) which establishes a connection between a
precondition \(A\), a program \(\alpha\), and a post-condition \(B\).
It indicates that whenever \(A\) holds as a precondition of the
execution of \(\alpha\), then \(B\) holds as a post-condition after
the successful execution of \(\alpha\).</p>

<p>
It was true some decades ago, and it is still the case: validating a
program is more often than not done by testing it on a reasonable
variety of inputs. When an input does not yield the expected output,
the &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is fixed. If eventually for every tested input
we obtain the expected output, one has a reasonable belief that the
program has no error. However, this is a time consuming method of
validation, and it leaves place for untested inputs that could fail.
Finding these errors after the program has been implemented and gone
into use is even more costly in resources. Reasoning about program
correctness with formal methods is crucial for critical systems since
it offers a way of proving exhaustively that a program has no
errors.</p>

<h3 id="HoarCalc">3.1 Hoare calculus</h3>

<p>
To illustrate the sort of principles of programs captured by the rules
in the Hoare calculus it is enough to consult some of them. (N.B.: the
rules mean that if all the statements above the rule line
hold&mdash;the premises&mdash;then also the statement under the rule
line&mdash;the conclusion&mdash; holds.)</p> 
\[
\frac{\{A\}\alpha_1 \{B\}\quad\{B\} \alpha_2\{C\}}
    {\{A\} \alpha_1;\alpha_2\{C\}}
\text{ (rule of composition)}
\]

<p>
The rule of composition captures the elementary sequential composition
of programs. As premises, we have two assumptions about the partial
correctness of two programs \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\). The first
assumption is that when \(\alpha_1\) is executed in a state satisfying
\(A\), then it will finish in a state satisfying \(B\), whenever it
halts. The second assumption is that when \(\alpha_2\) is executed in
a state satisfying \(B\), then it will finish in a state satisfying
\(C\), whenever it halts. The conclusion of the rule is about the
partial correctness of the program \(\alpha_1;\alpha_2\) (i.e.,
\(\alpha_1\) sequentially composed with \(\alpha_2\)), that follows
from the two assumptions. Namely, we can conclude that if
\(\alpha_1;\alpha_2\) is executed in a state satisfying \(A\), then it
finishes in a state satisfying \(C\), whenever it halts.</p>

<p>
The rule of iteration is an important one because it captures the
essential ability of programs to execute some portion of code
repeatedly until a certain condition ceases to hold.</p> 
\[
\frac{\{A \land B\}\alpha\{A\}}
     {\{A\} \mathsf{while}~B~\mathsf{do}~\alpha \{\lnot B \land A\}}
 \text{ (rule of iteration)}
\]

<p>
Finally, the two rules of consequence are fundamental to give a formal
basis to intuitively clear reasoning involving weaker post-conditions
and stronger preconditions respectively.</p> 
\[
\frac{\{A\}\alpha\{B\}\quad B \rightarrow C}
     {\{A\} \alpha \{C\}}
 \text{ (rule of consequence 1)}
\]
 
\[
\frac{C\rightarrow A\quad \{A\}\alpha\{B\}}
     {\{C\}\alpha\{B\}}
 \text{ (rule of consequence 2)}
\]

<p>
From the formalism presented in Hoare [1969], we leave out its axiom
schemas as it would require a first-order language. Finally, in
subsequent work on Hoare logic, more rules are also often added. See
Apt [1979] for an early overview.</p>

<h3 id="HoarCalcPDL">3.2 Hoare calculus and PDL</h3>

<p>
Dynamic logics come from Pratt&rsquo;s interpretation of Hoare triples
and Hoare calculus in the formalism of modal logic. With the modality
\([\alpha]\), we can express formally that all states reachable by
executing the program \(\alpha\) satisfy the formula \(A\). This is
done by writing \([\alpha]A\). Thus, the Hoare triple
\(\{A\}\alpha\{B\}\) is simply captured by the PDL formula</p>

<p class="indent">
\(A \rightarrow [\alpha]B\). </p>

<p>
In addition, important programming constructs are easily introduced in
PDL by definitional abbreviation:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\mathsf{if}~ A ~\mathsf{then}~ \alpha ~\mathsf{else}~ \beta :=
((A?;\alpha) \cup (\lnot A?;\beta))\)</li>

<li>\(\mathsf{while}~ A ~\mathsf{do}~ \alpha := ((A?;\alpha)^*;\lnot
A?)\)</li>

<li>\(\mathsf{repeat}~ \alpha ~\mathsf{until}~ A := (\alpha;((\lnot
A;\alpha)^*;A?))\)</li>

<li>\(\mathsf{abort} := 0?\)</li>

<li>\(\mathsf{skip} := 1?\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, it seems that with PDL we are well-equipped to logically prove
the correctness of structured programs. Beyond this rather hand-waving
connection between PDL and Hoare calculus, perhaps it is not yet clear
how they relate formally. PDL is in fact a generalization of Hoare
calculus in the sense that all the rules of the Hoare calculus can be
proven in the axiomatic system of PDL. (Rigorously, the Hoare calculus
contains axioms that would require the extended language of
first-order Dynamic Logic.) This is quite remarkable, so we will show
how they can be derived.</p>

<p>
The proofs start by assuming the premises of the rules. Then by using
these assumptions, axioms and rules of PDL, and nothing else, the
objective is to establish that the conclusion of the rules logically
follows. Hence, for the rule of composition, we start by assuming
\(\{A\}\alpha_1\{B\}\), that is \(A \rightarrow [\alpha_1]B\) in its
PDL formulation, and by assuming \(\{B\}\alpha_2\{C\}\), that is \(B
\rightarrow [\alpha_2]C\). The objective is to prove that
\(\{A\}\alpha_1;\alpha_2\{C\}\). Precisely, we want to establish that
\(A \rightarrow [\alpha_1;\alpha_2]C\) is \(\vdash\)-deducible from
the set of formulas \(\{A \rightarrow [\alpha_1]B, B \rightarrow
[\alpha_2]C\}\).</p>

In the context of PDL, the two rules of consequence are in fact
special cases of the rule of composition. To obtain the first rule,
substitute \(\alpha_1\) with \(\alpha\) and \(\alpha_2\) with
\(\mathsf{skip}\). To obtain the second rule, substitute \(\alpha_1\)
with \(\mathsf{skip}\) and \(\alpha_2\) with \(\alpha\). It suffices
to apply the axiom schema (A4), and to remark that
\([\alpha;\mathsf{skip}]A \leftrightarrow [\alpha]A\) and
\([\mathsf{skip};\alpha]A \leftrightarrow [\alpha]A\) are also
\(\vdash\)-deducible for all \(A\) and all \(\alpha\).</p>

<h3 id="TotaCorr">3.3 Total correctness</h3>

<p>
By Hoare&rsquo;s own admission in Hoare [1979], his original calculus
was merely a starting point and suffered quite a few limitations.
Particularly, it only allows one to reason about <em>partial</em>
correctness. That is, the truth of a statement \(\{A\}\alpha\{B\}\)
only makes sure that all executions of \(\alpha\) starting in a state
satisfying \(A\) will end in a state satisfying \(B\), <em>or will not
halt</em>. That is, a partially correct program may have
non-terminating executions. (In fact, a program that has no
terminating execution will always be partially correct. This is the
case for example of the program \(\mathsf{while}~ 1 ~\mathsf{do}~
\mathsf{skip}\). The formula \(A \rightarrow [\mathsf{while}~1
~\mathsf{do} ~\mathsf{skip}] B\) is deducible for all formulas \(A\)
and \(B\).) The calculus offers no basis for a proof that a program
terminates. It can be modified so as to account for <em>total</em>
correctness of programs: partial correctness plus termination. It is
achieved by amending the rule of iteration. We do not present it here
and refer the interested reader to Apt [1981].</p>

<p>
Let us first observe that for <em>deterministic</em> programs, one can
already capture total correctness via formulas of the kind</p>

<p class="indent">
\(A \rightarrow \langle\alpha\rangle B\). </p>

<p>
The expression \(\langle\alpha\rangle B\) means that there is an
execution of \(\alpha\) that terminates in a state that satisfies
\(B\). Moreover, if \(\alpha\) is deterministic, this possible
terminating execution is the unique execution of \(\alpha\). Thus, if
one first manages to prove that a program is deterministic, this trick
works well enough to prove its total correctness.</p>

<p>
A general solution to the problem of total correctness exists in the
realm of PDL. But we need to extend it a little. Pratt had already
alluded in Pratt [1980b] that PDL is not expressive enough to capture
the infinite looping of programs. In reaction, PDL with repeating
(RPDL) was introduced by Streett [1982]. It contains, for all programs
\(\alpha\), the expression \(\Delta\alpha\) standing for a new
proposition with semantics:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li>\(V(\Delta\alpha) = \{x: \) there exists an infinite sequence
\(z_0, z_1, \ldots\) of states such that \(z_0 = x\) and for all \(n
\geq 0, z_n R(\alpha) z_{n+1}\}\).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Streett [1982] conjectured that RPDL can be axiomatized by adding to
the proof system of PDL precisely the following axiom schemas.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(A6)</dt>
<dd>\(\Delta\alpha \rightarrow \langle\alpha\rangle
\Delta\alpha\)</dd>
<dt>(A7)</dt>
<dd>\([\alpha^*](A \rightarrow \langle\alpha\rangle A) \rightarrow (A
\rightarrow \Delta\alpha)\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The proof of the conjecture was provided in Sakalauskaite and Valiev
[1990]. (A version of the conjecture in the variant of combinatory PDL
was also proved in Gargov and Passy [1988].)</p>

<p>
It is easy to see that in the Hoare calculus presented above, non
termination can only come from the rule of iteration. Analogously, non
termination of a PDL program can only come from the use of the
unbounded iteration. The expression \(\Delta\alpha\) indicates that
\(\alpha^*\) can diverge, and this is just the kind of notion we need.
We can now inductively define a predicate \(\infty\) such that for a
program \(\alpha\), the formula \(\infty(\alpha)\) will be true
exactly when \(\alpha\) can enter a non-terminating computation.</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\infty(\pi) := 0\) where \(\pi\in\Pi_0\)
<br />
\(\infty(A?) := 0\)
<br />
\(\infty(\alpha \cup \beta) := \infty(\alpha)\ \lor \infty(\beta)\)
<br />
\(\infty(\alpha ; \beta) := \infty(\alpha) \lor \langle\alpha\rangle
\infty(\beta)\)
<br />
\(\infty(\alpha^*) := \Delta\alpha \lor \langle\alpha^*\rangle
\infty(\alpha)\) </p>

<p>
Finally, the total correctness of a program can be expressed via
formulas of the kind</p>

<p class="indent">
\(A \rightarrow (\lnot \infty(\alpha) \land [\alpha]B)\), </p>

<p>
which means literally that if \(A\) is the case, then the program
\(\alpha\) cannot run forever, and every successful execution of
\(\alpha\) will end in a state satisfying \(B\).</p>

<h2 id="SomeVari">4. Some variants</h2>

<p>
Results concerning comparative power of expression, decidability,
complexity, axiomatization and completeness of a number of variants of
PDL obtained by extending or restricting its syntax and its semantics
constitute the subject of a wealth of literature. We can only say so
much and we will address just a few of these variants leaving out big
chunks of otherwise important work in dynamic logic.</p>

<h3 id="PDLWithTest">4.1 PDL without tests</h3>

<p>
The axiom schema \([A?]B \leftrightarrow (A \rightarrow B)\) seems to
indicate that for every formula \(C\), there exists an equivalent
test-free formula \(C'\)&mdash;i.e., there is a test-free formula
\(C'\) such that \(\models C \leftrightarrow C'\). It is interesting
to observe that this assertion is untrue. Let PDL<sub>0</sub> be the
restriction of PDL to test-free regular programs, i.e., programs which
do not contain tests. Berman and Paterson [1981] considered the PDL
formula \(\langle (p?;\pi)^*;\lnot p?;\pi;p?\rangle 1\), which is</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\langle \mathsf{while}~ p~ \mathsf{do}~ \pi \rangle \langle \pi
\rangle p\), </p>

<p>
and proved that there is no PDL<sub>0</sub> formula equivalent to it.
Hence, PDL has more expressive power than PDL<sub>0</sub>. Their
argument actually can be generalized as follows. For all \(n \geq 0\),
let PDL<sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> be the subset of PDL in which programs
can contain tests \(A?\) only if \(A\) is a PDL<sub><em>n</em></sub>
formula. For all \(n \geq 0\), Berman and Paterson considered the
PDL<sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> formula \(A_{n+1}\) defined by</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\langle \mathsf{while}~ A_n~ \mathsf{do}~ \pi_n\rangle \langle
\pi_n\rangle A_n\), </p>

<p>
where \(A_0 = p\) and \(\pi_0 = \pi\) and proved that for all \(n \geq
0\), there is no PDL<sub><em>n</em></sub> formula equivalent to
\(A_{n+1}\). Hence, for all \(n \geq 0\), PDL<sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>
has more expressive power than PDL<sub><em>n</em></sub>.</p>

<h3 id="PDLConv">4.2 PDL with converse</h3>

<p>
CPDL is the extension of PDL with converse. It is a construct that has
been considered since the beginning of PDL. For all programs
\(\alpha\), let \(\alpha^{-1}\) stand for a new program with
semantics</p>

<p class="indent">
\(xR(\alpha^{-1})y\) iff \(yR(\alpha)x\). </p>

<p>
The converse construct allows us to express facts about states
preceding the current one and to reason backward about programs. For
instance, \([\alpha^{-1}]A\) means that before executing \(\alpha\),
\(A\) had to hold. We have</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\models A \rightarrow [\alpha]\langle \alpha ^{-1}\rangle A\)
<br />
\(\models A \rightarrow [\alpha ^{-1}]\langle \alpha \rangle A\) </p>

<p>
The addition of the converse construct does not change the
computational properties of PDL in any significant way. By adding
every instance of the following axiom schemas</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(A8)</dt>
<dd>\(A \rightarrow [\alpha ]\langle \alpha^{-1}\rangle A\)</dd>
<dt>(A9)</dt>
<dd>\(A \rightarrow [\alpha^{-1}]\langle \alpha \rangle A\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
to the proof system of PDL, we obtain a sound and complete
deducibility predicate in the extended language. See Parikh [1978] for
details. CPDL has the small model property and (CPDL-SAT) is
EXPTIME-complete.</p>

<p>
It is easy to notice that CPDL has more expressive power than PDL. To
see this, consider the CPDL formula \(\langle \pi^{-1}\rangle 1\) and
the LTSs \(M = (W, R, V)\) and \(M' = (W', R', V')\) where \(W =
\{x,y\}\), \(R(\pi) = \{(x,y)\}\), \(W' = \{y'\}\), \(R'(\pi) =
\emptyset\) and \(V(x) = V(y) = V'(y') = \emptyset\). Since \(M, y\)
sat \(\langle \pi^{-1}\rangle 1\), not \(M', y'\) sat \(\langle \pi
^{-1}\rangle 1\), and because for all PDL formulas \(A\) it is the
case that \(M, y\) sat \(A\) iff \(M', y'\) sat \(A\), then it is
clear that no PDL formula is equivalent to \(\langle \pi^{-1}\rangle
1\).</p>

<h3 id="PDLRepeLoop">4.3 PDL with repeating and looping</h3>

<p>
We have already exposed the power of repeating in
 <a href="#TotaCorr">section 3.3</a>
 by introducing RPDL. Here, we summarize more results about RPDL and
its connection with other variations on the notion of repeating
programs.</p>

<p>
Concerning the complexity theory of RPDL, Streett [1982] had already
established that RPDL had the finite model property; precisely that
every RPDL satisfiable formula <em>A</em> is satisfiable in a model of
size at most triply exponential in the length of <em>A</em>. An
automata-theoretic argument permitted to conclude that the problem
(RPDL-SAT) can be solved in deterministic triple exponential time
(3-EXPTIME). The gap between this upper bound for deciding (RPDL-SAT)
and the simple exponential-time lower bound for deciding (PDL-SAT) was
thus open. The problem found itself greatly connected to the growing
interest of computer scientists in establishing the complexity of
temporal logics, and more specifically of the (propositional) modal
\(\mu\)-calculus (MMC) due to Kozen [1983], because RPDL has a linear
blow-up translation to MMC. In Vardi and Stockmeyer [1985], an upper
bound in non-deterministic exponential time was shown. In Emerson and
Jutla [1988] and in its final form in Emerson and Jutla [1999], it was
shown that (MMC-SAT) and (RPDL-SAT) are EXPTIME-complete. If we add
the converse operator of
 <a href="#PDLConv">section 4.2</a>
 one obtains CRPDL. The complexity of (CRPDL-SAT) remained open for a
few years but it can be shown to be EXPTIME-complete, too. This is
achieved by combining the techniques of Emerson and Jutla [1988] and
Vardi [1985], as in Vardi [1998].</p>

<p>
In
 <a href="#TotaCorr">section 3.3</a>
 we have defined a predicate \(\infty\), where \(\infty(\alpha)\)
means that the program \(\alpha\) can have a non-terminating
computation. We call LPDL the logic obtained by augmenting PDL with
the predicate \(\infty\). Clearly, RPDL is at least as expressive as
LPDL; The inductive definition of \(\infty(\alpha)\) in the language
of RPDL is the witness of it. RPDL is in fact strictly more expressive
than LPDL. This was shown in Harel and Sherman [1982]. As it can be
suspected, both RPDL and LPDL have more expressive power than PDL. It
is established by proving that some formulas of RPDL and of LPDL have
no equivalent expression in PDL. The proof involves the technique of
<em>filtration</em> which is designed to collapse an LTS to a finite
model while leaving invariant the truth or falsity of certain
formulas. For some set of PDL formulas \(X\), it consists in grouping
into equivalence classes the states of an LTS that satisfy exactly the
same formulas in \(X\). The set of equivalence classes of states thus
obtained becomes the set of states of the filtrate model, and a
transition is built appropriately over them.</p>

<p>
With a carefully chosen set \(FL(A)\) that depends on a PDL formula
\(A\) (the so-called Fischer-Ladner closure of the set of sub-formulas
of \(A\)), a filtration of an LTS \(M\) yields a finite filtrate model
\(M'\), such that \(A\) is satisfiable at a world \(u\) in \(M\) if
and only if it is satisfiable in the equivalence class containing
\(u\) in the filtrate. (See Fischer and Ladner [1979].)</p>

<p>
We can now consider the filtration of the LTS \(M=(W,R,V)\) such
that</p>

<ul>

<li>\(W = \{(i,j) : j \text{ and } i \text{ integers}, 1 \leq j \leq
i\} \cup \{ u \}\)</li>

<li>\((i,j)R(\pi )(i,j-1)\) when \(1 \leq j \leq i\)</li>

<li>\(uR(\pi )(i,i)\) for every \(i\)</li>

<li>\(V(p) = \emptyset\) for every \(p \in \Phi_0\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In one sentence, what goes on in \(M\) is that from the world \(u\),
there is an infinite number of finite \(\pi\)-paths of growing length.
We have both \(M, u\) sat \(\lnot\Delta\pi\) and \(M, u\) sat
\(\lnot\infty(\pi^*)\). Yet, for every PDL formula \(A\), we will have
both \(\Delta\pi\) and \(\infty(\pi^*)\) that are satisfied at the
equivalence class of \(u\) in the model obtained by filtration of
\(M\) with \(FL(A)\). Indeed, the filtration must collapse some states
of \(M\) and create some loops. Thus, there exists no PDL formula that
can express \(\Delta\pi\) and there exists no PDL formula that can
express \(\infty(\pi^*)\).</p>

<p>
There are other ways of making possible the assertion that a program
can execute forever. For instance, Danecki [1984a] proposed a
predicate \(\mathsf{sloop}\) to qualify programs that can enter in
strong loops, that is:</p>

<p class="indent">
\(V(\mathsf{sloop}(\alpha)) = \{x: xR(\alpha)x\}\). </p>

<p>
Let us call SLPDL the logic obtained by augmenting PDL with formulas
\(\mathsf{sloop}(\alpha)\). RPDL and SLPDL are essentially
incomparable: the predicate \(\Delta\) is not definable in SLPDL, and
the predicate \(\mathsf{sloop}\) is not definable in RPDL. SLPDL does
not possess the finite model property. For example, the formula</p>

<p class="indent">
\([\pi^*](\langle\pi\rangle 1 \land \lnot\mathsf{sloop}(\pi^+))\) </p>

<p>
is satisfiable in infinite LTSs only. Nonetheless, Danecki [1984a]
established the decidability of (SLPDL-SAT) formulas in deterministic
exponential time.</p>

<h3 id="PDLInte">4.4 PDL with intersection</h3>

<p>
Another construct has been studied: the intersection of programs. By
adding intersection of programs to PDL, we obtain the logic IPDL. In
IPDL, for all programs \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), the expression \(\alpha
\cap \beta\) stands for a new program with semantics</p>

<p class="indent">
\(xR(\alpha \cap \beta )y\) iff \(xR(\alpha)y\) and \(xR(\beta)y\).
</p>

<p>
For instance, the intended reading of \(\langle \alpha \cap \beta
\rangle A\) is that if we execute \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) in the
present state then there exists a state reachable by both programs
which satisfies \(A\). As a result, we have</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\models \langle \alpha \cap \beta \rangle A \rightarrow \langle
\alpha \rangle A \land \langle \beta \rangle A\), </p>

<p>
but, in general, we have</p>

<p class="indent">
not \(\models \langle \alpha \rangle A \land \langle \beta \rangle A
\rightarrow \langle \alpha \cap \beta \rangle A\). </p>

<p>
Although the intersection of programs is important in various
applications of PDL to artificial intelligence and computer science
(e.g., in the context of concurrency), the proof theory and the
complexity theory of PDL with intersection remained unexplored for
several years. Concerning the complexity theory of IPDL, difficulties
appear when one considers the finite model property. In fact the
construct \(\mathsf{sloop}(\alpha)\) can be expressed in IPDL. In
propositional dynamic logic with intersection it is equivalent to
\(\langle \alpha \cap 1?\rangle 1\). We can thus adapt the formula of
SLPDL of
 <a href="#PDLRepeLoop">section 4.3</a>,
 and we have that</p>

<p class="indent">
\([\pi^*](\langle \pi \rangle 1 \land [\pi^+ \cap 1?]0)\) </p>

<p>
is satisfiable in infinite LTSs only. In other words, IPDL does not
possess the finite model property. Danecki [1984b] investigated the
complexity theory of IPDL and showed that deciding (IPDL-SAT) can be
done in deterministic double exponential time. (A modern proof is
presented in G&ouml;ller, Lohrey and Lutz [2007].) The complexity gap
between this double exponential-time upper bound for deciding
(IPDL-SAT) and the simple exponential-time lower bound for deciding
(PDL-SAT) obtained by Fischer and Ladner [1979] remained open for more
than twenty years. In 2004, Lange [2005] established the lower bound
of exponential space of (IPDL-SAT). In 2006, Lange and Lutz [2005]
gave a proof of a double exponential-time lower bound of the
satisfiability problem for IPDL without tests by a reduction from the
word problem of exponentially space-bounded alternating Turing
machines. In this reduction, the role of the iteration construct is
essential since, according to Massacci [2001], the satisfiability
problem for iteration-free IPDL without tests is only PSPACE-complete.
Adding the converse construct to IPDL, we obtain ICPDL. The
satisfiability problem of ICPDL has been proved to be
2-EXPTIME-complete by G&ouml;ller, Lohrey and Lutz [2007].</p>

<p>
Concerning the proof theory of IPDL, difficulties appear when we
realize that no axiom schema, in the language of PDL with
intersection, &ldquo;corresponds&rdquo; to the semantics \(xR(\alpha
\cap \beta)y\) iff \(xR(\alpha)y\) and \(xR(\beta)y\) of the program
\(\alpha \cap \beta\). That is, not in the same way for example, that
the axiom schemas (A1) and (A2) &ldquo;correspond&rdquo; to the
semantics of the programs \(\alpha;\beta\) and \(\alpha \cup \beta\),
respectively. For this reason, the axiomatization of PDL with
intersection was open until the complete proof system developed in
Balbiani and Vakarelov [2003].</p>

<p>
In another variant of PDL, due to Peleg [1987] and further studied by
Goldblatt [1992b], the expression \(\alpha \cap \beta\) is interpreted
&ldquo;do \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) in parallel&rdquo;. In this
context, the binary relations \(R(\alpha)\) and \(R(\beta)\) are no
longer sets of pairs of the form \((x,y)\) with \(x\) and \(y\)
worlds, but rather sets of pairs of the form \((x, Y)\) with \(x\) a
world and \(Y\) a set of worlds. It was inspired by the Game Logic of
Parikh [1985], an intepretation of PDL with &ldquo;programs as
games&rdquo;. Game Logic provides an additional program construct that
dualizes programs, thus permitting to define the intersection of
programs as the dual of the non-deterministic choice between
programs.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This article has focused on propositional dynamic logic and some of
its significant variants. There are by now a number of
books&mdash;Goldblatt [1982], Goldblatt [1992a], Harel [1979] and
Harel, Kozen and Tiuryn [2000]&mdash;and survey papers&mdash;Harel
[1984], Kozen and Tiuryn [1990], Parikh [1983] &mdash;treating PDL and
related formalisms. Pratt offers in Pratt [2017] an informal and
personal perspective on the development of dynamics logics which also
has a historical value. The body of research on PDL is certainly
instrumental in developing many logical theories of system dynamics.
However, these theories are arguably out of the scope of the present
article. Van Eijck and Stokhof [2006] is a more recent overview of
topics making use of dynamic logic, addressing various themes that are
of certain interest for philosophers: e.g., dynamics of communication,
or natural language semantics. Recent books are going in much details
on newer topics, such as dynamic logic of knowledge (dynamic epistemic
logic) in Van Ditmarsch, Van Der Hoek and Kooi [2007], and the dynamic
logic of continuous and hybrid systems (differential dynamic logic) in
Platzer [2010]. PDL was conceived primarily for reasoning about
programs. There are many other applications of modal logic to the
reasoning about programs. Algorithmic logic is closer to PDL since it
allows one to talk explicitly about programs. The reader is invited to
consult the work presented in Mirkowska and Salwicki [1987]. Temporal
logics are now the chief logics in theoretical computer science and
have a close connection with logics of programs. They allow one to
express the temporal behavior of transition systems with a language
that abstracts away from the labels (hence the programs). See for
instance Schneider [2004] for an overview of the foundations in this
research area.</p>
